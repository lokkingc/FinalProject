You start the project by running main.py. It will then prompt
you to input a command, which you can see the list of by
inputting help. The descriptions of each command will also
be listed. Then input the command with the proper parameters
and it will run the command. Commands include:

addstock, which adds stock to the database based on a csv file
adjustprice, which changes the price of a specific item
clearstock and cleartrans, which clear the stock and transaction tables respectively
savestock and savetrans, which save the stock and transaction tables to a csv file
removeitem, which removes an item from the Stock table
sellitem, which removes a certain amount of an item from the Stock table
viewitem, viewstock, and viewtrans, which allow you to view an item's price and quantity or the two tables

The tables will remain unchanged even after you quit the program
which allows you to change it whenever you want

Challenging parts of this project included finding a good way 
to sell items as well as finding an efficient way of accessing the
necessary data.

Some potential areas for improvement would be making a checkout cart 
that you add items to and then finally check out. Another thing would 
be to calculate the profits over a period of time based on how much stock
was added and how much was sold.
